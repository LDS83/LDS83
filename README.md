Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate from the **Palm Beach Code School** and I'm currently immersing myself in the world of coding. My current focus is on mastering **React**, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

As a developer, I'm passionate about learning new technologies and improving my skills. I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and GitHub is the perfect platform for me to showcase my projects, collaborate with others, and contribute to the open-source community.

I'm always open to feedback and suggestions on how to improve my code and development practices. So, feel free to take a look at my repositories and let me know if you have any ideas or suggestions.

Looking forward to connecting with you all on this exciting journey! ðŸš€
